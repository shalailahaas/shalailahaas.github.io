Shalaila S. Haas is a neuroscientist completing a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. After a clinically-oriented B.A. in Psychology from U.C. Berkeley and a methodologically-focused M.Sc. in Neuro-Cognitive Psychology, from the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich, Germany she went on to receive a Ph.D. in Medical Research from the LMU while simultaneously having received interdisciplinary training from the International Max Planck Research School in Translational Psychiatry.

She is interested in combining multimodal neuroimaging with multivariate methods to better understand the underlying neural mechanisms that affect prognosis and treatment response in patients with psychosis spectrum disorders. Recently, she investigated the neural underpinnings of language disturbances and symptoms in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis, and the potential shared or interacting neurobiological mechanisms linking them.
