Shalaila S. Haas is a neuroscientist and instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. After a clinically-oriented [B.A. in Psychology](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/) from U.C. Berkeley and a methodologically-focused M.Sc. in [Neuro-Cognitive Psychology](https://www.psy.lmu.de/ncp/index.html), from the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich, Germany she went on to receive a Ph.D. in Medical Research from the LMU while simultaneously having received interdisciplinary training from the International Max Planck Research School in [Translational Psychiatry](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/108493/alumni-and-friends).

She is interested in utilizing machine methods to link behavior with neural signatures (neurosignatures) for identification, prognosis, and treatment response prediction in various populations, with an emphasis on psychosis spectrum disorders. She has identified both structural and functional neurosignatures of symptoms and language dysfunction, age-related cognitive decline, and response to computerized cognitive training. Her current research seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms driving heterogeneity of the clinical presentation and course of psychosis spectrum disorders, and its relation to accelerated aging in schizophrenia.
