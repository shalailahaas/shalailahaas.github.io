Shalaila S. Haas is a cognitive neuroscientist with a specialization in implementing advanced machine learning techniques to identify links between behavioral patterns and neural signatures. Her work is particularly focused on the identification, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response primarily in psychosis spectrum disorders. 

She is currently an Instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. After a clinically-oriented [B.A. in Psychology](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/) from U.C. Berkeley and a methodologically-focused M.Sc. in [Neuro-Cognitive Psychology](https://www.psy.lmu.de/ncp/index.html), from the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich, Germany she went on to receive a Ph.D. in [Translational Psychiatry](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/108493/alumni-and-friends) from the International Max Planck Research School.

Her research aims to unravel the underlying mechanisms that drive the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and progression of psychosis spectrum disorders. She also seeks to better understand mechanisms that contribute to  accelerated aging and schizophrenia. This innovative research holds immense potential to advance our comprehension of these complex disorders, offering opportunities for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to alleviate suffering by either preventing the onset of psychosis or by improving the illness course.
