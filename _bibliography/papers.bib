  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Cognitive remediation (CR) is nowadays mainly administered in a computerized fashion, yet frequently supplemented by human guidance. The effects of CR on cognitive, functional and clinical outcomes are consistently reported, yet the response is heterogeneous. In order to resolve this heterogeneity, we employed a multi-outcome meta-analytic approach, examined effects of CR on each outcome category separately and estimated directed effects between three outcome categories. We extracted treatment effects from 67 studies that trained patients with schizophrenia (total n = 4067) using either 1) computerized CR modality alone or 2) in combination with supplementary human guidance (SHG). All three outcome domains were significantly improved by CR with small to moderate effect sizes when assessing outcomes across all studies. The comparison between CR administered with SHG revealed largest effects on the cognitive subdomains of working and verbal memory. Structural equation modeling in the single-study data suggests that cognitive gains trigger restoration of psychosocial functioning which in turn facilitates improvement in clinical symptoms.}

  abstract={Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), as well as their unaffected siblings (SIB), show functional connectivity (FC) alterations during performance of tasks involving attention. As compared with SCZ, these alterations are present in SIB to a lesser extent and are more pronounced during high cognitive demand, thus possibly representing one of the pathways in which familial risk is translated into the SCZ phenotype. Our aim is to measure the separability of SCZ and SIB from healthy controls (HC) using attentional control-dependent FC patterns, and to test to which extent these patterns span a continuum of neurofunctional alterations between HC and SCZ. 65 SCZ with 65 age and gender-matched HC and 39 SIB with 39 matched HC underwent the Variable Attentional Control (VAC) task. Load-dependent connectivity matrices were generated according to correct responses in each VAC load. Classification performances of high, intermediate and low VAC load FC on HC-SCZ and HC-SIB cohorts were tested through machine learning techniques within a repeated nested cross-validation framework. HC-SCZ classification models were applied to the HC-SIB cohort, and vice-versa. A high load-related decreased FC pattern discriminated between HC and SCZ with 66.9% accuracy and with 57.7% accuracy between HC and SIB. A high load-related increased FC network separated SIB from HC (69.6% accuracy), but not SCZ from HC (48.5% accuracy). Our findings revealed signatures of attentional FC abnormalities shared by SCZ and SIB individuals. We also found evidence for potential, SIB-specific FC signature, which may point to compensatory neurofunctional mechanisms in persons at familial risk for schizophrenia.}

  abstract={Neurocognitive deficits are one of the core features of psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD), and they are predictive of poor functional outcome and negative symptoms many years later (Green, Kern, Braff, & Mintz, 2000). Neurocognitive interventions (NCIs) have emerged in the last two decades as a strong potential supplementary treatment option to improve cognitive deficits and drop in functioning affecting patients with PSD. Social cognitive training (SCT) involving e.g., facial stimuli has gained considerably more attention in recent studies than computerized NCIs, that use basic visual or auditory stimuli. This is due to the complex character of social cognition (SC) that draws on multiple brain structures involved in behaviors and perception beyond default cognitive function. SC is also tightly interlinked with psychosocial functioning. Although they are cost-effective and quite independent of clinical staff, such technological approaches as SCT are currently not integrated into routine clinical practice. Recent studies have mapped the effects of SCT in task-based studies on multiple brain regions such as the amygdala, putamen, medial prefrontal cortex, and postcentral gyrus (Ramsay & MacDonald III, 2015). Yet, the degree to which alterations in brain function are associated with response to such interventions is still poorly understood. Importantly, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may be a viable neuromarker as it has shown greater sensitivity in distinguishing patients from healthy controls (HC) across neuroimaging studies, and is relatively easy to administer especially in patients with acute symptoms (Kambeitz et al., 2015). In this dissertation, we employed 1) a univariate statistical approach to elucidate the efficacy of a 10-hour SCT in improving cognition, symptoms, functioning and the restoration of rsFC in patients undergoing SCT as compared to the treatment as usual (TAU) group, and 2) multivariate methods. In particular, we used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to neuromonitor the recovery of rsFC in the SCT group compared to TAU. We also investigated the potential utility of rsFC as a baseline (T0) neuromarker viable of predicting role functioning approximately 2 months later. First, current findings suggest a 10-hour SCT has the capability of improving role functioning in recent-onset psychosis (ROP) patients. Second, we have shown intervention-specific rsFC changes within parts of default mode and social cognitive network. Moreover, patients with worse SC performance at T0 showed greater rsFC changes following the intervention, suggestive of a greater degree of rsFC restoration potential in patients with worse social cognitive deficits. Third, when referring to neuromonitoring results, it is important to state that only greater transition from ROP to “HC-like” SVM decision scores, based on the resting-state modality, was paralleled by intervention specific significantly greater improvement in global cognition and attention. Finally, we were able to show the early prediction of good versus poor role functioning is feasible at the individual subject level using a rsFC-based linear SVM classifier with a Balanced Accuracy (BAC) of 74 %. This dissertation sheds light on the effects and feasibility of a relatively short computerized SCT, and the potential utility of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for better clinical stratification of predicted treatment response based on rsFC neuromarkers.},

  abstract={Multivariate pattern recognition analyses (MVPA) have the potential to identify brain pattern alterations across the entire brain due to their capacity to extract the innate interregional dependencies of distributed brain pathologies from high-dimensional training data and generalize the learned discriminative rules to unseen patient cohorts (Kambeitz et al., 2015). While MVPA applied on structural data has been confirmed to be a very valuable biomarker for patients with psychosis (Koutsouleris et al., 2009), the MVPA classification based on functional connectivity FC alterations might be promising better sensitivity than structural measures (Kambeitz et al., 2015). Recent studies employing these methods have been able to show accuracies as high as 93 %, but these studies have focused on using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data in order to diagnose patients in later stages with established schizophrenia (Wolfers et al., 2015). We used rsfMRI images from 19 healthy controls (HC) and 19 recent onset psychosis (ROP) patients obtained from PRONIA 1 to differentiate healthy from psychosis individuals. Correlation matrices between brain regions were used as features for multivariate analysis. The machine learning pipeline wrapped into repeated nested cross-validation was used to train a multi-modal diagnostic system and evaluate its generalization capacity in new subjects. Ultimately, the predictions of the different training partitions were combined into classifier ensembles, which provided a final group membership prediction through averaging. The top features were extracted in order to determine the regions of FC that were most discriminative for the classification. We found an overall classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 86.8 %, 78.9 %, and 94.7 % on rsfMRI data in patients with ROP and HC. In line with previous studies with ROP patients employing uni-and multivariate analyses of resting-state FC, we found an overall alteration in FC in widespread regions of the brain both inter-and intrahemispheric, but also with both long and short range FC between regions contributing to the classifier (Alonso-Solís et al., 2012; Fornito et al., 2011, 2013; Liang et al., 2006). Marked alterations occurred between various parts of the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain. When correlating the decision scores extracted from the classifier with neuropsychological scores, only the forward digit span, measuring short-term memory functions, showed significant results. Resting-state FC data can be used to discriminate ROP patients from HC.}

  abstract={Background: Findings from neurodevelopmental studies indicate that adolescents with psychosis spectrum disorders have delayed neurocognitive performance relative to the maturational state of their healthy peers. Using machine learning, we generated a model of neurocognitive age in healthy adults and investigated whether individuals in clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis showed systematic neurocognitive age deviations that were accompanied by specific structural brain alterations. Methods: First, a Support Vector Regression-based age prediction model was trained and cross-validated on the neurocognitive data of 36 healthy controls (HC). This produced Cognitive Age Gap Estimates (CogAGE) that measured each participant's deviation from the normal cognitive maturation as the difference between estimated neurocognitive and chronological age. Second, we employed voxel-based morphometry to explore the neuroanatomical gray and white matter correlates of CogAGE in HC, in CHR individuals with early (CHR-E) and late (CHR-L) high risk states. Results: The age prediction model estimated age in HC subjects with a mean absolute error of ±2.2 years (SD = 3.3; R2 = 0.33, P < .001). Mean (SD) CogAGE measured +4.3 (8.1) years in CHR individuals compared to HC (−0.1 (5.5) years, P = .006). CHR-L individuals differed significantly from HC subjects while this was not the case for the CHR-E group. CogAGE was associated with a distributed bilateral pattern of increased GM volume in the temporal and frontal areas and diffuse pattern of WM reductions. Conclusion: Although the generalizability of our findings might be limited due to the relatively small number of participants, CHR individuals exhibit a disturbed neurocognitive development as compared to healthy peers, which may be independent of conversion to psychosis and paralleled by an altered structural maturation process.}

	abstract = {Abstract The brain-age-gap estimate (brainAGE) quantifies the difference between chronological age and age predicted by applying machine-learning models to neuroimaging data and is considered a biomarker of brain health. Understanding sex differences in brainAGE is a significant step toward precision medicine. Global and local brainAGE (G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE, respectively) were computed by applying machine learning algorithms to brain structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 1113 healthy young adults (54.45\% females; age range: 22-37 years) participating in the Human Connectome Project. Sex differences were determined in G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE. Random forest regression was used to determine sex-specific associations between G-brainAGE and non-imaging measures pertaining to sociodemographic characteristics and mental, physical, and cognitive functions. L-brainAGE showed sex-specific differences; in females, compared to males, L-brainAGE was higher in the cerebellum and brainstem and lower in the prefrontal cortex and insula. Although sex differences in G-brainAGE were minimal, associations between G-brainAGE and non-imaging measures differed between sexes with the exception of poor sleep quality, which was common to both. While univariate relationships were small, the most important predictor of higher G-brainAGE was self-identification as non-white in males and systolic blood pressure in females. The results demonstrate the value of applying sex-specific analyses and machine learning methods to advance our understanding of sex-related differences in factors that influence the rate of brain aging and provide a foundation for targeted interventions.},
