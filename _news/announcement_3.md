I was invited to give a guest talk at Columbia University on my work linking the reliability of processing naturalistic auditory information with language and thought disorder across the psychosis spectrum. Thank you <a href='https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/gaurav-h-patel-md'>Gaurav Patel</a>  for the invitation and insightful discussions!
