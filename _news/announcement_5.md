I was invited to give three guest lectures for the WP4 course on "Introduction to multivariate and neuroimaging methods" within the Master's in <a href="https://www.psy.lmu.de/ncp/curriculum/course_requirements/index.html">Neuro-Cognitive Psychology</a> at the Ludwig Maximilian University. 


### Course description and topics:
In the last two decades of psychiatric research, we are witnessing a growing interest in machine learning and neuroimaging methods. This course will equip students with basic
knowledge on multivariate methods (supervised and unsupervised), neuroimaging (structural and functional) and their application in different modalities of psychiatric research. The
scientific literature will mostly focus on psychosis, depression and clinical high-risk state. In the first part of the course students will be strongly encouraged to gain knowledge on
aforementioned topics by attending lectures, reading state-of-art literature and practicing presentation skills. In the second part this course our students will analyze clinical data using
R studio software while provided with intensive coaching by the tutors. At the end of the course students should be able to use a “novel platform” of modern psychiatry knowledge
which provides a deeper understanding of potential biomarkers for psychiatric disorders and methods used for the analysis.
